README

This Bash script is designed to aid in the reconnaissance phase of security testing by gathering domain information from various sources. It utilizes the following tools:

assetfinder: A tool for finding subdomains
subfinder: A subdomain discovery tool that discovers valid subdomains for websites
amass: A tool to help information security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and external asset discovery using open-source information gathering and active reconnaissance techniques.
Usage:

Ensure you have the necessary tools (assetfinder, subfinder, and amass) installed on your system.
Clone the repository or download the script directly from GitHub.
Make the script executable: chmod +x script_name.sh
Run the script: ./script_name.sh
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the domain you wish to gather information about.
Important Notes:

This script relies on external tools (assetfinder, subfinder, and amass). Ensure they are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
The script gathers domain information from multiple sources and saves the output into separate text files (t1.txt, t2.txt, t3.txt).
It's essential to review the gathered information carefully and ensure it aligns with your testing scope and ethical considerations.
This script does not perform any intrusive actions. However, always use such tools responsibly and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
For more information about each tool and its usage, please refer to their respective documentation and resources.
